Intro:

An academy of higher learning where lots of successful ponies have gone to has offered you a chance to attend as a part of an "outreach" impetus to gather more students from far away to increase diversity in culture and experience. There are some mysterious things about the academy in particular, such as, spoken of in whispered tones, ponies going missing and then that happenstance being covered up. Obviously, those are just rumors due to jealous individuals who haven't been accepted to attend. You are obviously excited and a little bit nervous to start a new life in Horsemouth Academy.

Setting:

The whole school is a setup to bring in prey that won't be missed to feed the more elite class of preds. Though occasionally a pony might surprise them and take to predation with gusto, or at least be enough fun to keep around. Vore happens behind closed doors and in private classes out of the main studeny body's sight. A good first test for Freshman is their final period class, which teaches some rather obscure biological niches. Strangely anyone who squirms too much tends to be assigned some lunchtime projects.

The important thing for you will be fitting in. Looking too much like an outsider paints you as a target and makes you an easy meal. Another student would have to help you learn the ways of predation. Of course refusing to participate at all and trying to leave is something the staff will have anticipated and have means to deal with. To that end the headmistress and faculty are all in on what happens.

Main Characters: 

Limeâ€™s Team: 
Name: Rhystalia. Tall and thick body type. 4th year student, studying crystal-based magic. She uses the crystal magic as a ward to keep other would-be preds away, and the crystals can also serve as remote viewing cameras. In class she's withdrawn, not very sociable. She's not popular, but has a reputation as someone who is not to be trifled with. She has strict parents who imparted an outwardly haughty attitude on her. She thinks her prey are becoming a part of something better than they'd ever be on their own. During chapter one she always wears a cloak and sometimes a hood to conceal herself. You never see her eat anyone, and you're reticent to ask if she's a pred or not. When you ask her directly, she toys with you and won't say. After she finally eats a pony in front of you, she reveals that her butt mark is very obviously for eating others. A total freak in bed, she will definitely have at least one sex scene. Her sadistic side in vore manifests itself as she's quite the controlling domme in bed. Probably a sex scene while she's digesting someone. If you have disposal turned on, she might get nasty and have you lick her asshole clean after taking a fat pony dump.

Scene: Without much warning on an otherwise normal day, she corners you and your best friend. She offers a deal, one of you gets eaten and has to rub the other inside her gut. If you say no, your best friend agrees to her terms and you get a bad end.

Scene: She thinks that a high performing classmate who has a crush on you has stolen her homework to get a better grade than her. As revenge, she has you ask the classmate out on a date, but you're really bringing them to her so she can eat them.

At the end of her storyline, you can either offer yourself as a meal for her graduation present, or live as her feeder/sex slave until she gets tired of you.

Side Characters:

Blissey's Nurse: Enters ponies and fixes them from the inside. Very pred friendly. Prescribes pony meals.

Pepper Dust: Math teacher.
